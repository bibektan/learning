	- Dynamic URL generation: The URLs of the videos and other content may be generated dynamically, which makes it difficult to predict the URL and download the content directly.
	- Streaming: The content may be streamed to the user's device instead of being downloaded, which makes it harder to capture and save the content.
	- Encrypted content: The content may be encrypted, which means that it cannot be accessed or played without the proper decryption keys or software.
	- Session-based authentication: The user's authentication and session information may be stored in cookies or other mechanisms, which makes it harder to access the content outside of an authorized session.
		- Session-based tokens are one way to authenticate a user's access to video content. When a user logs in to a website or platform, a session is created that includes a unique token. This token is then used to verify the user's identity and permissions when they access video content.
		- When a user requests to view a video, the server checks their token to see if they have permission to view it. If they do, the server then streams the video content to the user's browser using a temporary URL that is generated on the fly. This URL typically includes the user's token and is valid for a limited amount of time, usually just long enough for the video to be viewed.
		- This approach helps to prevent unauthorized access to video content because the video file itself is never exposed to the user's browser. Instead, the server streams the content on demand and uses the session-based token to authenticate the user's access. Even if a user were to somehow obtain the temporary URL for a video file, the URL would be valid for only a short period of time and would be useless after it expired.

		- One common approach is to use token-based authentication, where the server generates a temporary access token that is embedded in the video player code along with the video URL. This token is then checked by the server to ensure that only authorized users can access the video stream.
		- Another approach is to use server-side scripting to generate the video URLs dynamically, rather than hard-coding them in the HTML. This makes it more difficult for attackers to discover and download the video files directly.
		- Another option is to use a proprietary video player that can only play encrypted videos. This approach involves embedding an encryption key within the player itself, and the video file is decrypted on-the-fly during playback.
