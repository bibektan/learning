		- Short-circuit evaluation is a technique in JavaScript that allows a programmer to use logical operators (`&&` and `||`) in such a way that the evaluation of the expression stops as soon as the final result can be determined. This helps to improve the performance of code by avoiding unnecessary evaluations.
		- Here's an example using the `&&` operator:
		- ```
		  const x = 5;
		  const y = x > 0 && "x is positive";
		  console.log(y); // Output: "x is positive"
		  ```
		- In this example, `x > 0` is evaluated first. If it's `true`, then `"x is positive"` is evaluated and its value is assigned to `y`. If `x > 0` were `false`, then `y` would be assigned `false` without evaluating `"x is positive"`.
		- Here's another example using the `||` operator:
		- ```
		  const name = "";
		  const displayName = name || "Guest";
		  console.log(displayName); // Output: "Guest"
		  ```
		- In this example, `name` is evaluated first. If it's truthy (i.e., not `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `NaN`, `""`, or `false`), then its value is assigned to `displayName`. If `name` were falsy, then `"Guest"` would be evaluated and its value would be assigned to `displayName`.
		- Short-circuit evaluation is a convenient and efficient way to write conditional logic in JavaScript. By using it, you can avoid evaluating expressions that are not necessary, which can improve the performance of your code.
