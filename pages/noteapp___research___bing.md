- # some of the problems that users face in note-taking apps are:
	- They are not effective for learning and studying, as they encourage passive and superficial note-taking, rather than active and deep learning.
	- They are slow, buggy, or unreliable, as they may crash, freeze, or go offline unexpectedly, causing frustration and inconvenience for users.
	- They are not good for handwriting, math, or science, as they may not support stylus input, equations, diagrams, or symbols, limiting the expressiveness and clarity of notes.
	- They are not good for active recall and spaced repetition, as they may not have features that allow users to test their memory, review their notes, or schedule their repetitions, enhancing the retention and recall of information.
	- They are not good for privacy and security, as they may store users’ data on cloud servers, share users’ data with third parties, or expose users’ data to hackers, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of notes.
	-
- ### Therefore, some of the features that a new app could have to solve these problems are:
	- It could provide guidance and feedback on how to take effective notes, such as using the Cornell method, the Feynman technique, or the SQ3R method, to help users learn and understand the material better.
	- It could be fast, stable, and reliable, as it would have a robust and optimized code, a backup and recovery system, and an offline mode, to ensure users’ satisfaction and convenience.
	- It could support handwriting, math, and science, as it would have a stylus input, an equation editor, a diagram tool, and a symbol library, to enable users to express and communicate their ideas clearly.
	- It could facilitate active recall and spaced repetition, as it would have a quiz generator, a flashcard maker, a review planner, and a progress tracker, to help users remember and apply their knowledge better.
	- It could protect privacy and security, as it would have a local storage option, a data encryption feature, a user consent policy, and a security audit, to safeguard users’ data and trust.
