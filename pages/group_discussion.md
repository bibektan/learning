- More and more decision-making power is assigned to algorithms that generate, 
  for example, personalized advertisements.
  What are the challenges and opportunities that you see in this trend?
	-
	- Algorithms are computer programs that use statistical methods and data inputs to make decisions or predictions.
	- ## challenges
		- risk of bias: algorithms decision-making depends on the data inputs, if the data is biased or incomplete, it can lead algorithms making decisions that are also biased, and potentially discriminatory. This can perpetuate existing inequalities in society and create unfair outcomes.
		- potential errors: Algorithms can be prone to errors or glitches, leading to incorrect decisions that can have serious consequences.
		- Ethical concerns: who is responsible for the decisions made by algorithms and what kinds of decisions are appropriate for algorithms to make.
		- lack of human judgement
		- lack of transperency
	- ## Opportunities
		- Efficiency: Algorithms can be more efficient and consistent than human decision-makers
		- Greater insight: Algorithms can process large amounts of data quickly and identify patterns and insights that might not be apparent to humans, leading to better decision-making.
		- Personalization: Algorithms can be used to personalize products and services to individual users, leading to a better user experience.
		- Lower costs: Algorithms can be less expensive than hiring human decision-makers, allowing for greater scalability in decision-making processes.
