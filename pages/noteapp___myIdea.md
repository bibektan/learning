- few more things about note features:
	- user can create another page just by wrapping the word by double square brackects i.e. [[]];
	- sometimes author want to give a short definition for the term without redirecting to the whole page dedicated for that term. For that author wants to open a modal box with the definition or anything about that term when clicked. So, there is a feature for that when author wraps the word inside double Parentheses, a new block similar to page will be created for that term, there author can put any information. Finally when reader click that particular term modal box open with information inside. Also author can reuse this block for this term in different notes by creating multiple definitions and selecting a particular definition for particular note/blog.

- ## problems
	- Nobody is going to type thier academic notes on app.
-
-
- I also want this app used by professors, researchers and scientists. What features should I built to make them use my app?
	- 1.  Support for LaTeX: Many researchers and scientists use LaTeX to write papers and reports. Including support for LaTeX in your app would make it more attractive to this group.
	- 2.  Reference management: An important aspect of academic research is managing references. You could add a feature that allows users to easily manage and insert references in their notes.
	- 3.  Collaboration tools: Researchers and scientists often work in teams, so adding collaboration tools such as real-time editing and commenting would be useful.
	- 4.  Advanced search capabilities: Academic research often involves finding specific information in large amounts of data. Advanced search capabilities, such as the ability to search by date range or specific fields, would be helpful.
	- 5.  Integration with academic databases: Many academic researchers use specialized databases for their research. Integrating your app with these databases would be a valuable feature.
	- 6.  Integration with citation tools: Many academic researchers use citation tools such as Zotero or Mendeley. Integrating your app with these tools would make it easier for researchers to manage their citations.
	- 7.  Data visualization: Scientists often work with large datasets and visualizations can be a powerful tool for understanding complex information. You could consider adding data visualization capabilities to your app.

- # additional features to considered
	- 1.  Integration with other apps: Many users rely on other apps to create content such as images, videos, and audio recordings. Providing integrations with these apps can enhance the app's functionality and make it easier for users to create comprehensive notes.

	- 3.  Audio and Video Transcription: Some users may prefer to dictate their notes, record audio or video, and have the app automatically transcribe the content into text. This can be a helpful feature for users who are unable to type, or for those who want to save time.
	- 4.  Reminders and Notifications: Including the ability to set reminders and notifications for notes can be helpful for users who need to remember specific tasks or deadlines associated with their notes.
	- 5.  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Using AI and machine learning to suggest related notes, provide personalized recommendations, or automatically tag notes based on content can make the app more intuitive and easier to use.
	- 6.  Offline Access: Providing the ability to access notes offline can be a useful feature for users who may not have consistent internet access or who prefer not to store their notes in the cloud.
	- 7.  Collaboration Features: Enhancing the collaboration features to include real-time editing and commenting, version control, and permission levels can make the app more appealing to businesses and academic groups.
